# flatten_the_curve

Simulate the key metrics of a pandemic like COVID19 and display the results in pretty charts. The goal is to gamify the simulation by letting a user control some parameters and see their effects.

This simulation is not based on research or actual data. It is a simple simulator made to resemble what is seen on TV.
