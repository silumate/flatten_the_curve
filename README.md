# flatten_the_curve
Simulate the key metrics of a pandemic like COVID19 and display the results in pretty charts.  The goal is to gamify the simulation by letting a user control some parameters and see their effects.

This simulation is not based on research or actual data.  It is a simple simulator made to resemble what is seen on TV.
